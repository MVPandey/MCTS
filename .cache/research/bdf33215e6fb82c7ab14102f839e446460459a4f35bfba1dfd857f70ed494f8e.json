{"report": "# Enhancing the Muon Optimizer for NanoGPT Speedrun: A Strategic Research Approach\n\nThe pursuit of optimizing the Muon optimizer for the NanoGPT speedrun presents a compelling research direction with significant implications for efficient large language model (LLM) training. This report will explore strategic approaches and domain knowledge to identify the most promising avenues for enhancing Muon's performance, focusing on psychological tactics, persuasion techniques, domain facts, potential objections and counter-arguments, and negotiation strategies.\n\n## Understanding the Landscape: Muon and NanoGPT Speedrun\n\nThe Muon optimizer is a relatively new algorithm designed to improve the training efficiency of neural networks, particularly in the context of LLMs. It achieves this by orthogonalizing the update matrix at each step, which amplifies rarer update directions in the representational space, and requires only half the GPU memory compared to ADAM ([FitzGerald, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jackgmfitzgerald_muon-can-achieve-up-to-double-the-training-activity-7364286437950722049-Wvib)). The NanoGPT speedrun is a competitive task focused on minimizing the time required to train a small GPT-2 model (124M parameters) to a specific validation loss on the FineWeb dataset ([Jordan, 2024](https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/)).\n\n### Current State of Muon in NanoGPT\n\nMuon has already demonstrated success in the NanoGPT speedrun, contributing to significant reductions in training time ([Jordan, 2024](https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/)). Specifically, it was instrumental in reducing the training time to achieve a validation loss of 3.28 on FineWeb, a target that matches Andrej Karpathy's GPT-2 (small) reproduction ([Jordan, 2024](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt)). The modded-nanogpt repository showcases the historical progression of world speed records for this task, highlighting Muon's contribution ([Jordan, 2024](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt)).\n\n### Potential Areas for Improvement\n\nSeveral avenues exist for enhancing Muon's performance in the NanoGPT speedrun:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Understanding**: Deepening the theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence properties and its interaction with modern architectural optimizations can lead to targeted improvements ([Mehta et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24406)).\n2.  **Architectural Synergies**: Exploring synergistic interactions between Muon and architectural optimizations like Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) could yield multiplicative efficiency gains ([Mehta et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24406)).\n3.  **Implementation Optimizations**: Optimizing the implementation of Muon, such as distributing its overhead, can further reduce training time ([Jordan, 2024](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt)).\n4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning Muon's hyperparameters, potentially using automated techniques, can lead to improved performance for specific tasks and architectures.\n5.  **Adaptive Techniques**: Investigating adaptive techniques that dynamically adjust Muon's behavior during training could enhance its robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Strategic Approaches for Research\n\nTo effectively improve Muon for the NanoGPT speedrun, a strategic research approach is essential. This involves leveraging psychological tactics, persuasion techniques, domain facts, addressing potential objections, and employing negotiation strategies.\n\n### Psychological Tactics and Persuasion Techniques\n\n1.  **Framing**: Presenting the research as a continuation of the existing success in NanoGPT speedrunning can build confidence and attract collaborators. Highlighting the potential for significant impact on LLM training efficiency can further enhance its appeal.\n2.  **Authority**: Citing established researchers and publications in the field can lend credibility to the research. Emphasizing the theoretical foundations and empirical validation of Muon can also strengthen its perceived authority.\n3.  **Social Proof**: Showcasing the existing adoption of Muon in projects like Kimi K2 and GLM 4.5 can demonstrate its practical value and encourage others to explore its potential ([FitzGerald, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jackgmfitzgerald_muon-can-achieve-up-to-double-the-training-activity-7364286437950722049-Wvib)).\n4.  **Scarcity**: Emphasizing the limited number of researchers working on Muon optimization can create a sense of urgency and attract talented individuals to the field.\n5.  **Reciprocity**: Contributing to open-source projects and sharing research findings can foster a collaborative environment and encourage others to contribute to the effort.\n\n### Domain Facts and Knowledge\n\n1.  **Optimizer Landscape**: A thorough understanding of the optimizer landscape, including the strengths and weaknesses of ADAM, AdamW, and other alternatives, is crucial for positioning Muon effectively ([FitzGerald, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jackgmfitzgerald_muon-can-achieve-up-to-double-the-training-activity-7364286437950722049-Wvib)).\n2.  **Transformer Architecture**: A deep understanding of transformer architectures, including their computational bottlenecks and memory requirements, is essential for identifying opportunities to optimize Muon's performance.\n3.  **Hardware Considerations**: Knowledge of the hardware used in NanoGPT speedruns, such as NVIDIA H100 GPUs, is important for tailoring optimizations to specific hardware capabilities.\n4.  **Performance Metrics**: Familiarity with performance metrics like training time, validation loss, and FLOPs is necessary for evaluating the effectiveness of different optimization strategies.\n5.  **NanoGPT Speedrun History**: Understanding the history of the NanoGPT speedrun, including the key innovations that have led to record-breaking times, can provide valuable insights for future research ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/nanogpt-speedrun)).\n\n### Potential Objections and Counter-Arguments\n\n1.  **Generalizability**: A common objection to optimizer research is the lack of generalizability to larger models and datasets. To address this, the research should focus on theoretical analysis and empirical validation across a range of model scales.\n2.  **Overhead**: Muon's orthogonalization step may introduce computational overhead. Addressing this requires optimizing the implementation of the orthogonalization process, potentially using techniques like Newton-Schulz iteration ([Jordan, 2024](https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/)).\n3.  **Stability**: Orthogonalization may lead to instability during training. This can be mitigated by carefully tuning hyperparameters and incorporating regularization techniques.\n4.  **Complexity**: Muon is more complex than simpler optimizers like SGD. Justifying this complexity requires demonstrating significant performance gains and providing a clear understanding of its theoretical benefits.\n5.  **Adoption**: Many new optimizers fail to gain widespread adoption. To increase the likelihood of adoption, the research should focus on providing a user-friendly implementation, comprehensive documentation, and clear benchmarks demonstrating its advantages.\n\n### Negotiation Strategies\n\n1.  **Collaboration**: Collaborating with researchers from different backgrounds, including optimization experts, hardware specialists, and LLM practitioners, can bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the project.\n2.  **Open Source**: Releasing the research findings and code as open-source can foster a collaborative community and encourage others to contribute to the effort.\n3.  **Benchmarking**: Establishing clear benchmarks and comparing Muon's performance against state-of-the-art optimizers can provide objective evidence of its advantages.\n4.  **Incremental Improvements**: Focusing on incremental improvements and demonstrating their impact on the NanoGPT speedrun can build momentum and attract further investment.\n5.  **Communication**: Clearly communicating the research findings and their implications to the broader machine learning community can increase awareness and adoption of Muon.\n\n## Concrete Research Directions\n\nBased on the above strategic considerations, the following research directions appear most promising:\n\n1.  **Adaptive Orthogonalization**: Develop adaptive techniques that dynamically adjust the degree of orthogonalization based on the training progress and the specific characteristics of the model and dataset. This could involve using a learning rate schedule or a feedback mechanism to control the orthogonalization strength.\n2.  **Low-Precision Orthogonalization**: Investigate the use of low-precision arithmetic (e.g., FP16 or BF16) for the orthogonalization step to reduce computational overhead and memory requirements. This requires careful analysis to ensure that the low-precision orthogonalization does not significantly degrade performance.\n3.  **Hybrid Optimization**: Combine Muon with other optimization techniques, such as AdamW or LMO-based optimizers, to leverage their respective strengths. For example, Muon could be used for the initial stages of training to accelerate convergence, while AdamW could be used for fine-tuning to improve generalization.\n4.  **Hardware-Aware Optimization**: Tailor Muon's implementation to specific hardware architectures, such as NVIDIA H100 GPUs, to maximize performance. This could involve using specialized kernels or optimizing memory access patterns.\n5.  **Theoretical Analysis of Generalization**: Conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of Muon's generalization properties to understand why it performs well in practice and to identify potential areas for improvement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImproving the Muon optimizer for the NanoGPT speedrun requires a multifaceted approach that combines theoretical understanding, empirical validation, strategic thinking, and effective communication. By focusing on the most promising research directions, addressing potential objections, and leveraging psychological tactics and persuasion techniques, it is possible to significantly enhance Muon's performance and contribute to the advancement of efficient LLM training. The NanoGPT speedrun serves as a valuable benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of different optimization strategies and for driving innovation in the field.\n\n## References\n\nFitzGerald, J.
